# Repository bootstrap

Status: **staged locally**. GitHub-side rulesets and secret scanning are applied
by `workflow-devops/infra/scripts/github/bootstrap.sh` after the mirror exists.

## Baseline

- Default branch: `main`
- Merge: squash only; linear history; delete branch after merge
- Required review: 1 human approval
- Force push and branch deletion: denied
- Tags: `v*` protected
- Secret scanning and push protection: GitHub native
- Dependabot: `.github/dependabot.yml`
- Code owners: `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Public repositories carry public data only
- Ingested data lives in `gardusi-gustavo/database` and arrives by PR

## Machine record
